Some small programs for my master thesis.
B.txt contains an example basis matrix
OGS.cpp performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation 
HadCo.cpp calculates the Hadamard coefficient
LagrangeGauss.cpp performs the Lagrange-Gauss reduction on a 2x2 basis matrix
SeizRed.cpp perform the size reduction on an n x n basis matrix
BasicLLL.cpp perform the most basic form of the LLL reduction on an n x n basis matrix
all of the above programs need a file containing a basis matrix (written in the same manner as an example in B.txt) as a parameter
