# master_thesis
Some small programs for my master thesis.<br />
B.txt contains an example basis matrix<br />
OGS.cpp performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation<br /> 
HadCo.cpp calculates the Hadamard coefficient<br />
LagrangeGauss.cpp performs the Lagrange-Gauss reduction on a 2x2 basis matrix<br />
SeizRed.cpp perform the size reduction on an n x n basis matrix<br />
BasicLLL.cpp perform the most basic form of the LLL reduction on an n x n basis matrix<br />
all of the above programs need a file containing a basis matrix (written in the same manner as an example in B.txt) as a parameter<br />
